# Developing VAE models for EEG feature extraction

## Large Data Files

Due to the size of the data files, links to access them will be uploaded on this Google Doc:

### Current files:
* `output_epochs.pkl`
* `output_epochs_cz.pkl`
* `processed_data_cz.pt`

## Running the Code

To ensure reproducibility, my results were achieved by resetting the runtime on Google Colab between each training/fine-tuning process with a set seed and deterministic algorithm (included in the code).
